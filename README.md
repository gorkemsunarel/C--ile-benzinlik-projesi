# Gas Station Simulation (C#)

## Project Overview
This is a C# gas station simulation application that demonstrates a simplified fueling process.  
The program simulates cars approaching a gas station with different fuel types (Gasoline, Diesel, LPG).  
When a user clicks on a car, the refueling process starts. Once the car is fully fueled, its status turns green and it drives away.

## Features
- Simulation of vehicles arriving at a gas station
- User interaction to trigger refueling
- Supports multiple fuel types (Gasoline, Diesel, LPG)
- Visual status change when fueling is completed (green indicator)

## Technologies Used
- **C#**
- **.NET (Console or Windows UI depending on implementation)**
- Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Purpose of the Project
This project was developed to strengthen understanding of:
- C# programming fundamentals
- Basic event and state handling
- Object-oriented design principles
- Simulating real-world processes in software

## What I Learned
- How to model real-world entities using classes
- Managing user interaction events
- Changing application state based on logic
- Writing readable and maintainable code

## Possible Improvements
- Add queue management for waiting vehicles
- Include a tank capacity and fuel stock system
- Add a graphical interface (Windows Forms / WPF)
- Track refueling logs or analytics
